Electrostatic Similarity
========================

The electrostatic similarity method generates grid potentials for a list of PDB files and compares 
all potential files in a pairwise manner. Here we will provide a test case that compares several 
members of a family of plant proteins. This example is based on a more comprehensive, published study [Chae2010]_.

.. currentmodule:: aesop
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api/generated/
    
    ElecSimilarity
    
Example case: LTP plant proteins
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Open a new python session, import the ElecSimilarity class, and import the plotDend and plotESD functions:: 

    from aesop import ElecSimilarity, plotDend, plotESD

Next, you must specify the full paths to your ``apbs`` and ``pdb2pqr`` executables, if 
the paths for the directories containing the executables have not already been added to the environment. 
Here is an example for a Windows system::

    path_apbs    = 'C:\\APBS\\apbs.exe'
    path_pdb2pqr = 'C:\\PDB2PQR\\pdb2pqr.exe'

Now we will specify what PDB files the method should compare. Here we will use only 3 PDB files 
(:download:`download<../data/LTP_pdb.zip>`). After downloading the PDB files, unzip them and place 
them in the current working directory::

    pdbfiles = ['1MZL.pdb', 'SCA1.pdb', 'SCA3.pdb']

.. warning::

    If you are using your own PDB, make sure the PDB contains no missing heavy atoms. Consider also removing non-standard
    amino acids. PDBFixer is one option for cleaning PDB files in preparation for AESOP.

When the method is run, intermediate files will be generated and stored in a folder of the current 
working directory. The user has the option of naming this folder by specifying a job name::

    jobname = 'LTP_test'

Next, the method is initialized by::

    family = ElecSimilarity(pdbfiles=pdbfiles, pdb2pqr_exe=path_pdb2pqr, apbs_exe=path_apbs, 
                            jobname=jobname)

Finally, we are ready to run the analysis. To superpose structures before running, set superpose 
to True. To center structures before running, set center to True. Ideally, the end user should 
ensure that all PDB structures have consistent coordinates. This analysis will take several minutes, 
so please be patient::

    family.run(superpose=True)

You can view results using built-in functions::

    plotDend(family, filename='dend.png')
    plotESD(family, filename='esd.png')

plotDend should produce a dendrogram similar to the following figure.

.. image:: dend.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

Proteins that cluster together at lower ESD in the dendrogram are expected to be electrostatically similar.

plotESD should produce a heatmap similar to the following figure.

.. image:: esd.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center
   
This heatmap compares all protein pairs in terms of ESD. Lower values once again indicate electrostatic similarity.
   
If you prefer to export the raw data, you can access the ESD matrix::

    data = family.esd

Other modules such as numpy (example below) or pandas will allow exporting of the ESD matrix to file::

    import numpy as np
    np.savetxt('esd_matrix.txt', data, fmt='%.4f')
