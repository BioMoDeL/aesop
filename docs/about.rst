About
=====

AESOP is a computational framework to investigate electrostatic interactions that promote association 
of protein complexes and to compare similarity of electrostatic potentials across families of proteins. 
In the former case, protein engineering (or re-engineering) of enzymes or other industrial proteins may 
benefit from AESOP by using the software to optimize association of some protein with its binding partner. 
In such applications, the activity of the protein system is diffusion-limited. By promoting association, 
the protein may be enhanced for its application.

AESOP was originally developed by Jianfeng Yang, Chris A. Kieslich [Kieslich2011-1]_. Further optimizations 
and additions for the R-based framework were implemented by Chris A. Kieslich and Ronald D. Gorham
