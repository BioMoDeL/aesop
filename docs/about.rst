About
=====

AESOP is a computational framework to investigate electrostatic interactions that promote association 
of protein complexes and to compare similarity of electrostatic potentials across families of proteins. 
In the former case, protein engineering (or re-engineering) of enzymes or other industrial proteins may 
benefit from AESOP by using the software to optimize association of some protein with its binding partner. 
In such applications, the activity of the protein system is diffusion-limited. By promoting association, 
the protein may be enhanced for its application.

AESOP is developed in the Biomolecular Modeling and design Lab (`BioMoDeL <http://biomodel.engr.ucr.edu>`_) under the supervision of Professor 
Dimitrios Morikis.  The python library of AESOP is developed by Reed Harrison and Rohith Mohan [Harrison2016]_, and 
is based on the original AESOP framework, written in R, that was developed and parametrized by Chris Kieslich 
and Ronald Gorham [Kieslich2011-1]_ [Gorham2011-1]_ [Gorham2011-2]_ [Kieslich2011-2]_. A preliminary computational protocol for electrostatic similarities that preceded 
AESOP was developed by Jianfeng Yang.

The AESOP acronym stands for Analysis of Electrostatic Structures Of Proteins.
The original AESOP acronym stood for Analysis of Electrostatic Similarities Of Proteins.
